# Adaptive-Grey-Wolf-Optimization-Algorithm (AGWO)

Python Implementation of AGWO algorithm 

# Run:
Run_scripts.py controls the general optimization parameters (Population size, number of runs, number of iterations)
Optimizers contains the algorithms of GWO (original from EvoloPy package), and AGWO. 
AGWO.py contains parameters of Adaptive GWO. 

The csv files are saved in the directory of './Results/'.
